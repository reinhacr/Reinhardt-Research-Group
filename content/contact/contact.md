## Openings for graduate students

The Reinhardt lab has multiple openings for **current graduate students at University of Vermont** broadly in the areas of bioinorganic computational chemistry, force field development, and enzyme catalysis. We anticipate recruiting maximum three students this year. Interested students are encouraged to reach out to Prof. Reinhardt via email.

For **students interested in coming to University of Vermont in the upcoming admissions cycle** for graduate school, graduate students can currently join our group from the Chemistry department. Students are encouraged to apply to the appropriate PhD program that matches their undergraduate training. Prof. Reinhardt will speak with students after admissions decisions are complete.
***

## Postdoctoral openings

We are currently interested in hiring a postdoctoral scholar. Applicants with a strong background in biochemistry and molecular dynamics, or inorganic chemistry are especially desirable. However, we will train an experimentalist with the right background or someone transitioning from more electronic structure backgrounds. Please see Openings for more details about how to apply.

## Undergraduates

Interested undergraduate students are always welcome to the lab if space is available. Please contact Prof. Reinhardt via email.
